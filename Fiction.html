			<p>The Salt Palace follows the story of wayward LDS banker, Brian Peterson as he makes his way back to his family home in Utah from Michigan with a mysterious fellow traveler met via a ride board. What follows is a harrowing trip across the country and through various histories of the U.S., the L.D.S. Church, and the story of the Utah Jazz. J. Robert Lennon called the book “Thoughtful, deadpan, and shot through with comic inspiration.”
