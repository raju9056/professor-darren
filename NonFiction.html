	<p>Darren DeFrain’s nonfiction (essays, reviews, esoteria) has appeared in numerous journals and magazines over the years. Since 2019 he has been working on a book with colleague Fran Connor on the postpunk history of Kansas called No Choice But Action. This book explores the years between roughly 1970 through the “invasion” of Lawrence in the mid-1990s by A&R types hoping to sign the next Nirvana. The book primarily focuses on Wichita, Topeka, Manhattan and Lawrence and examines the bands, venues, record stores, record studios, and fans that helped create and sustain the scene. No Choice But Action is under contract by KU Press.</p>
